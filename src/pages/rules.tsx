          Teams are restricted to a set of classes. We have a system in place to
          find characters that are the wrong class for your team. You may create
          a character belonging to a different class for the purpose of
          acquiring a specific skill gem, but you may not ascend on that
          character, nor will it be eligible for level points. If it determined
          that you are playing on an unascended character of the wrong class for
          longer than necessary to acquire those gems, the case will be treated
          as though you are in violation of this rule.

          Each team has its own tag, related to the team&apos;s name. When you
          make your character, please ensure that your character name begins
          with the tag associated with your team. For example, if Badger were on
          team Malice, he would name his character MAL_Badger (or something
          along those lines). If you create a character with an incorrect tag
          with the intention of acquiring items from other teams, you will be
          discovered and banned.

          BPL is a welcoming space, and it is important to ensure that everyone
          is being treated with respect. This includes members of opposing
          teams. Friendly banter is of course fine, but there will be a
          1-warning system for over-the-line aggressiveness. Be a reasonable
          person. This is a cooperative event, and any attempts to scam other
          people will not be tolerated. If someone tries to scam you, please
          report it to the Command Team, with evidence if you have any, and it
          will be addressed immediately.

          Helping the other teams undermines the integrity of the event, and we

          to people on other teams for free.

          immediately banned from the event and reported to GGG staff.

          The nature of this event is to randomly assign players to get them

          Embrace the RNG and improvise with your new teammates (and hopefully
          friends) to achieve victory. The sort is (with few exceptions) is
          random, and we try our best to make balanced teams.
