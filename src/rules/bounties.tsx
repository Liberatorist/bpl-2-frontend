      <h3>Submitting a bounty completion</h3>
      <p>
        To submit a completion click on the plus sign icon on the race card and
        fill in the form. You will need to provide a timestamp in your local
        timezone (your browser sets this for you) and a link to a proof of your
        completion. This can for example be a screenshot or a video. If there is
        more information you need to share for the reviewers you can add it in
        the comment field.
      </p>
      <p>
        BPL staff will manually credit points for races after the verification,
        if there are questions about a race condition please confirm with a BPL
        Admin or Manager prior to beginning the map/fight.
